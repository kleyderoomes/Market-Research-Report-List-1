<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polymer Antioxidant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Primary Antioxidants (Free-Radical Scavengers)</li><li>Secondary Antioxidants (Peroxide Scavengers)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Polymer Antioxidant Market is categorized into two main types: primary and secondary antioxidants. Primary antioxidants, or free-radical scavengers, directly neutralize free radicals, thereby preventing oxidative degradation of polymers. They include compounds like hindered phenols and amines. In contrast, secondary antioxidants, or peroxide scavengers, work by decomposing hydroperoxides into non-radical forms, thus inhibiting further oxidation. These antioxidants are essential in enhancing the stability and longevity of polymer products across various industries, including packaging, automotive, and electronics.</p></p>
